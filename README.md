_Causing is a multivariate graphical analysis tool helping you to interpret the causal
effects of a given equation system._ 
Get a nice colored graph and immediately understand the causal effects between the variables.

**Input:** You simply have to put in a dataset and provide an equation system in form of a
python function. The endogenous variable on the left-hand side are assumed being caused by
the variables on the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, you provide the causal structure
in form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**Output:** As an output you will get a colored graph of quantified effects acting between
the model variables. You are able to immediately interpret mediation chains for every
individual observation - even for highly complex nonlinear systems.

Further, the method enables model validation. The effects are estimated using a structural
neural network. You can check whether your assumed model fits the data. Testing for significance
of each individual effect guides you in how to modify and further develop the model.
The method can be applied to highly latent models with many of the modeled endogenous
variables being unobserved.

Here is a table relating Causing to other approaches:

The Causing approach is quite flexible. The most severe restriction certainly is that you need to specify the causal model / causal ordering. If you know the causal ordering but not the specific equations, you can let the Causing model estimate a linear relationship. Just plug in sensible starting values. 

Further, exogenous variables are assumed to be observed and deterministic. Endogenous variables instead may be manifest or latent and they might have error correlated terms. Error terms are not modeled explicitly, they are automatically dealt with in the regression / backpropagation estimation.

## Introduction Video

This 5 minute introductory video gives you a short overview and a real data example:

See [Causing_Introduction_Video](https://youtu.be/GJLsjSZOk2w "Causing_Introduction_Video")

## Software

Causing is a free software written in _Python 3_.
It makes use of _PyTorch_ for automatic computation of total derivatives
and _SymPy_ for partial algebraic derivatives. Graphs are generated
using _Graphviz_.

See dependencies in [setup.py](setup.py).

## Effects

Causing provides direct, total and mediation effects.
Using the given equation system, they are computed for individual observations and their total. Also, the average effects are estimated by fitting to the observed data.
The respective effects are abbreviated as:

Effects | Direct | Total | Mediation
--- | --- | --- | ---
Average effects | ADE | ATE | AME
Estimated effects | EDE | ETE | EME
Individual effects | IDE | ITE | IME

## Model Validation

To evaluate estimation, t-values are reported. To evaluate the necessity of effects,
t-values with respect to zero are shown (estimated effect divided by its standard deviation).
These t-values are expected to be significant. i.e. larger than two in absulute value.
Insignificant effects could indicate possible model simplifications.

To evaluate the validity of the hypothesized model , t-values with respect to the hypothesized
average model effects are used (estimated minus average effect and then divided by its standard
deviation). In this case, significant deviations could suggest a model refinement.

t-values | Direct | Total | Mediation
--- | --- | --- | ---
t-values wrt. zero | ED0 | ET0 | EM0
t-values wrt. model | ED1 | ET1 | EM1

Finally, for every equation we separately estimate a constant / bias term to quickly find
possibly misspecified equations. This could be the case for significant biases.

## Abstract

We propose simple linear algebra formulas for the causal analysis of equation systems.
The effect of one variable on another is the total derivative. We extend them to endogenous
system variables. These total effects are identical to the effects used in graph theory and
its do-calculus. Further, we define mediation effects, decomposing the total effect of one
variable on a final variable of interest over all its directly caused variables. This allows
for an easy but in-depth causal and mediation analysis.

To estimate the given theoretical model we define a structural neural network (SNN).
The network's nodes are represented by the model variables and its edge weights are given by
the direct effects. Identification could be given by zero restrictions on direct effects implied by
the equation model provided. Otherwise, identification is automatically achieved via ridge regression /
weight decay. We choose the regularization parameter minimizing out-of-sample sum of squared errors
subject to at least yielding a well conditioned positive-definite Hessian,
being evaluated at the estimated direct effects.

Unlike classical deep neural networks, we follow a sparse and 'small data' approach.
Estimation of structural direct effects is done using PyTorch and automatic differentiation
taylormade for fast backpropagation. We  make use of our closed form effect formulas in
order to compute mediation effects. The gradient and Hessian are also given in analytic form.

Note that in this paper the mediation effects on the final variable of interest are called final effects.

## Example

Assume a model defined by the equation system:

Y<sub>1</sub> = X<sub>1</sub>

Y<sub>2</sub> = X<sub>2</sub> + 2 * Y<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>

Y<sub>3</sub> = Y<sub>1</sub> + Y<sub>2</sub>.

This gives the following graphs. Some notes are in order to understand them:

- The data used consist of 200 observations. They are available for the x variables
X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> with mean(X<sub>1</sub>) = 3 and mean(X<sub>2</sub>) = 2.
Variables Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> are assumed to be latent / unobserved.
Y<sub>3</sub> is assumed to be manifest / observed.
Therefore 200 observations are available for Y<sub>3</sub>.

- Average effects are based on the hypothesized model. The median values of all exogenous
data is put into the given graph function, giving the corresponding endogenous values.
The effects are computed at this point.

- Individual effects are also based on the hypothesized model. For each individual,
however its _own_ exogenous data is put into the given graph function
to yiel the corresponding endogenous values.
The effects are computed at this individual point.

- Estimated effects are based on the hypothesized model: The zero restrictions
(effects being always exactly zero by model construction) are carried over and
the average hypothesized effects are used as starting values. However, effects are
estimated by fitting a _linearized_ approximate model using a structural neural network. 
Effects are fitted by minimizing squared errors of observed endogenous variables.
This corresponds to a nonlinear structural regression of
Y<sub>3</sub> on X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub> using all 200 observations.

- Mediation effects are shown exemplary for the final variable of interest,
assumed here to be Y<sub>3</sub>. In the mediation graph the nodes depict the total effect
of that variable on Y<sub>3</sub>. This effect is partitioned over all outgoing edges,
representing the mediation effects and thus enabling path interpretation.
Note however that incoming edges do not sum up to the node value.

- Individual effects are shown exemplary for individual no. 1 out of the 200 observations.
To ease their interpretation, each individual effect is multiplied by the absolute difference
of its causing variable to the median of all observations.
Further, we color nodes and edges, showing positive (_green_) and negative (_red_) effects
these deviations have on the final variable Y<sub>3</sub>.

Effects | Direct                                                      | Total                                                        | Mediation for Y<sub>3</sub>

As you can see in the bottom right graph for the individual mediation effects (IME),
there is one green path starting at X<sub>1</sub> passing through Y<sub>1</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>
and finally ending in Y<sub>3</sub>. This means that X<sub>1</sub> is the main cause for
Y<sub>3</sub> taking on a value above average with its effect being +37.44.
However, this positive effect is slightly reduced by X<sub>2</sub>. In total,
accounting for all exogenous and endogenous effects, Y<sub>3</sub> is +29.34 above average.
You can understand at one glance why Y<sub>3</sub> is above average for individual no. 1.

The t-values corresponding to the estimated effects are also given as graphs.
To assess model validation using the t-value graphs note the following:

- Estimated standard errors for the effects are derived from the Hessian. Test and t-vales
are asymptotically correct, but in small samples they suffer from the effects being biased
in the case of regularization.

- In this example regularization is required. The minimal regularization parameter is
0.000950 to obtain a well-posed optimization problem with a positive-definite Hessian.
The optimal regularization parameter minimizing out-of-sample squared errors is 0.001545.

- The t-values with respect to zero should be _larger_ than two in absolute value, indicating
that the specified model structure indeed yields significant effects.

- The t-values with respect to the hypothesized model effects should be _smaller_ than two in
absolute value, indicating that there is no severe devation between model and data.

- For the mediation t-value graphs EM0 and EM1 the outgoing edges do not some up to its
outgoing node. In the EM0 graph all outgoing edges are even identical to their outgoing node
because effects and standard deviations are partioned in the same way over their outgoing edges
thus cancelling out in the t-values. However, this is not true for the EM1 graph since
different partitioning schemes are used for the estimated and subtracted hypothesized model
effects.

Effects | Direct                                                   | Total                                                   | Mediation for Y<sub>3</sub>
--- |----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------| ---
t-values wrt. zero | ![Estimated Direct Effects (ED0)](https://github.com/realrate/Causing/raw/develop/images_readme/ED0.svg) | ![Estimated Total Effects (ET0)](https://github.com/realrate/Causing/raw/develop/images_readme/ET0.svg) | ![Estimated Mediation Effects (EM0)](https://github.com/realrate/Causing/raw/develop/images_readme/EM0.svg)

The t-values with respect to zero show that just some of the estimated effects are significant.
This could be due to the small sample size. In this example we estimate five direct effects
from 200 observations with the only observable endogenous variable being Y<sub>3</sub>.

None of the t-values with respect to the hypothesized model values is significant.
This means that the specified model fits well to the observed data.

Biases are estimated for each endogenous variable. Estimation is done at the point of
average effects implied by the specified model. That is, possible model misspecifications
are captured by a single bias, one at a time. Biases therefore are just one simple way
to detect wrong modeling assumptions.

Variable | Bias value | Bias t-value
--- | --- | ---
Y<sub>1</sub> | 0.00 | 0.64
Y<sub>2</sub> | 0.06 | 0.55
Y<sub>3</sub> | 0.06 | 0.55

In our example none of the biases is significant, further supporting correctness of model
specification.

## A Real World Example

To dig a bit deeper, here we have a real world example from social sciences.
We analyze how the wage earned by young American workers is determined by
their educational attainment, family characteristics, and test scores.

## Start your own Model

When starting `python -m causing.examples example` after cloning / downloading the Causing repository you will find
the example results described above in the _output_ folder. The results are saved in SVG files.

See `causing/examples` for the code generating these examples.

To run a model, you have to provide the following information, as done in the example code below:

- Define all your model variables as SymPy symbols.
- Note that in Sympy some operators are special, e.g. Max() instead of max().
- Provide the model equations in topological order, that is, in order of computation.
- Then the model is specified with:
    - _xvars_: exogenous variables
    - _yvars_: endogenous variables in topological order
    - _equations_: previously defined equations
    - _final_var_: the final variable of interest used for mediation effects

- To simulate data, we have to provide simulation parameters as in: 
  - _ymvars_: manifest / observed endogenous variables
  - _xmean_true_: mean of exogenous data
  - _sigx_theo_: true scalar error variance of xvars
  - _sigym_theo_: true scalar error variance of ymvars
  - _rho_: true correlation within y and within x vars
  - _tau_: no. of simulated observations

- In estimate_input, the inputs to be used for estimation, further specify
  - _ymvars_: manifest endogenous variables
  - _ymdat_: manifest endogenous data
  - _estimate_bias_: estimate equation biases, for model validation
  - _alpha_: regularization parameter, is estimated if None
  - _dof_: effective degrees of freedom, corresponding to alpha

In the example case the python SymPy function looks like this:

```python
def example():
    """model example"""

    X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Y3 = symbols(["X1", "X2", "Y1", "Y2", "Y3"])
    equations = (               # equations in topological order (Y1, Y2, ...)
        X1,
        X2 + 2 * Y1 ** 2,
        Y1 + Y2,
    )
    m = Model(
        xvars=[X1, X2],         # exogenous variables in desired order
        yvars=[Y1, Y2, Y3],     # endogenous variables in topological order
        equations=equations,
        final_var=Y3,           # final variable of interest, for mediation analysis
    )

    ymvars = [Y3]               # manifest endogenous variables
    xdat, ymdat = simulate(
        m,
        SimulationParams(
            ymvars=ymvars,
            xmean_true=[3, 2],  # mean of exogenous data
            sigx_theo=1,        # true scalar error variance of xvars
            sigym_theo=1,       # true scalar error variance of ymvars
            rho=0.2,            # true correlation within y and within x vars
            tau=200,            # nr. of simulated observations
        ),
    )

    estimate_input = dict(
        ymvars=ymvars,
        ymdat=ymdat,
        estimate_bias=True,     # estimate equation biases, for model validation
        alpha=None,             # regularization parameter, is estimated if None
        dof=None,               # effective degrees of freedom, corresponding to alpha
    )

    return m, xdat, ymdat, estimate_input
```

The files ADE, ATE, AME contain the average effects based on the median _xdat_ observation as well as the estimated effects (EDE, ETE, EME) using
the observed endogenous data _ymdat_.

The graphs ED0, ET0, EM0 contain the t-values graphs with respect to zero
and the graphs ED1, ET1, EM1 contain t-values graphs with respect to the hypothesised model.

The files IDE, ITE, IME show the individual effects for the respective individual.
